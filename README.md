# 👋 Hi, I’m @Svetlana

- 👀 I’m interested in building scalable, secure, and cost-optimized cloud infrastructure using AWS, Kubernetes, and Terraform.
- 🌱 I’m currently deepening my expertise in GitOps, multi-cloud architecture, and cloud security best practices.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source DevOps tools, Kubernetes operators, or projects that automate and simplify cloud-native development.
