Hi, I'm Svetlana! 

I’m a DevOps Engineer with a passion for building scalable, secure, and cost-efficient cloud infrastructures. With nearly 6 years of hands-on experience, I specialize in transforming complex systems into high-performing, automated environments using AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, and cutting-edge cloud-native technologies. 

 What I Do:
I thrive on automating everything — from cloud infrastructure to CI/CD pipelines, and microservices deployments to security solutions. I build resilient, flexible systems that make product deployment easier and safer for teams.

 Currently Exploring:

Deepening my expertise in cloud security to ensure iron-clad infrastructures

 My Philosophy:
I believe in the power of optimization — whether it’s fine-tuning a cloud environment, creating the most efficient automation scripts, or even finding ways to make my daily routines run smoother. Everything can be optimized, and I’m here to make it happen.
