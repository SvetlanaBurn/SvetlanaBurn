Hi, I'm Svetlana! 👋

I’m a DevOps Engineer with a passion for building scalable, secure, and cost-efficient cloud infrastructures. With nearly 6 years of hands-on experience, I specialize in transforming complex systems into high-performing, automated environments using AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, and cutting-edge cloud-native technologies. 🌐

🔧 What I Do:
I thrive on automating everything — from cloud infrastructure to CI/CD pipelines, and microservices deployments to security solutions. I build resilient, flexible systems that make product deployment easier and safer for teams.

🌱 Currently Exploring:

Advanced GitOps workflows to streamline CI/CD processes

Building multi-cloud architectures for added resilience

Deepening my expertise in cloud security to ensure iron-clad infrastructures

💬 Let’s Connect:
I’m always excited to collaborate on open-source DevOps tools, Kubernetes operators, or cloud-native development automation projects. If you share the same passion or need help with your cloud infrastructure, feel free to reach out!

💡 My Philosophy:
I believe in the power of optimization — whether it’s fine-tuning a cloud environment, creating the most efficient automation scripts, or even finding ways to make my daily routines run smoother. Everything can be optimized, and I’m here to make it happen.

When I’m not building high-performance infrastructure, you can find me exploring new ways to streamline processes and systems with ☕️
