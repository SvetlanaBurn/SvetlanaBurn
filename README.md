Hi, I'm @Svetlana! 👋

I’m a DevOps Engineer with a passion for building scalable, secure, and cost-optimized cloud infrastructures using AWS, Kubernetes, and Terraform. With nearly 6 years of experience, I specialize in transforming complex systems into automated, high-performance environments.

🔍 Currently, I'm focusing on:

GitOps workflows to streamline CI/CD pipelines

Multi-cloud architectures for resilience and scalability

Cloud security best practices to ensure robust infrastructure

  Let’s collaborate! I'm looking for opportunities to work on open-source DevOps tools, Kubernetes operators, or cloud-native development automation projects.

  Feel free to reach out through: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/svetlanaburn/) or email me at svetlana.devops@gmail.com
 
  My Approach: I believe in optimizing everything — whether it's cloud infrastructure or finding new ways to automate daily tasks. Efficiency drives everything I do.
